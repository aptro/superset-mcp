# Superset MCP Memory Management & Onboarding System

## Memory System Overview

The memory system allows storing and retrieving structured information across Superset sessions, enabling persistent knowledge, standardized analysis, and reusable patterns.

## Core Components

### Memory Management

- **Infrastructure**: JSON-based storage with indexing by categories, tags, and relationships
- **API Tools**:
  - `superset_memory_write` - Store custom memories
  - `superset_memory_write_standardized` - Create consistently structured memories
  - `superset_memory_read` - Retrieve memories by name
  - `superset_memory_list` - List all available memories
  - `superset_memory_search` - Find memories by metadata
  - `superset_memory_delete` - Remove memories
  - `superset_memory_auto_retrieve` - Automatically load relevant memories for a query

### Onboarding System

- **Instance Onboarding** (`superset_instance_onboard`):
  - Captures database count, dashboard count, dataset count
  - Creates memory index guide with organization best practices
  - Sets up memory category structure

- **Component Onboarding**:
  - `superset_database_onboard` - Collects schema and table information
  - `superset_dataset_onboard` - Captures columns, metrics, and visualization recommendations

- **Utilities**:
  - `superset_memory_prepare_chat_context` - Preloads essential memories
  - `superset_check_instance_onboarding_status` - Verifies instance setup

## Memory Structure

Each memory includes standardized metadata:
- Name (with category prefix conventions)
- Description
- Category (datasets, dashboards, databases, etc.)
- Tags for improved searchability
- Related memory references

## Benefits

- Persistent knowledge across conversations
- Standardized approaches to data analysis
- Reusable templates for common tasks
- Reduced API calls through memory caching
- Enhanced context awareness in AI assistance 

## Future Improvements

The Superset MCP memory system could be enhanced through:
• Graph-based knowledge structures replacing JSON storage
• Self-reflection tools for memory assessment and task persistence
• Optimized context management with priority-based retrieval
• Advanced semantic search using vector embeddings
• Collaborative memory features with appropriate permissions

Implementing these incrementally with Neo4j, FAISS, and LangChain would significantly improve context maintenance and analytical workflow assistance.
